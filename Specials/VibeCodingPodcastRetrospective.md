## Let's Start from the Beginning

About a month ago, the whole **vibe coding** trend really caught my attention. Everyone was talking about it, everyone. Blog posts were all over the internet, LinkedIn was full of non-technical folks suddenly turning into ‚Äúbuilders,‚Äù claiming they could create full-blown applications without knowing a thing about software engineering or coding.

At first, I didn't pay much attention. I figured it was just another passing trend, like Web3, the metaverse, or Windows Phone (which, to be fair, I actually liked, don't judge me). But then I started seeing even seasoned software engineers showing off their vibe coding setups (I know, it sounds weird), comparing different LLMs and workflows. 

Then came various posts and articles about predictions about vibe coding replacing developers entirely. Articles and posts from non-tech people forecasting the end of software engineering in 2, 5, 10, 30, 50 years (yeah, everyone had their own prediction, claiming to be true). That's when I told myself: Alright, I really need to find time I don't have and dig into this whole vibe coding thing because maybe it's more than just hype. I didn't want to be that guy in the disaster movie standing on the beach saying, ‚ÄúIt's just a little wave, it's gonna be fine!‚Äù five seconds before getting swallowed by a CGI tsunami called AI.

##  It Was Time to Act... Fast

I knew I had to research it as deeply as possible before saying a single word about vibe coding, especially in an article or on a podcast. Otherwise, I couldn't consider myself qualified to speak on the topic. 

I started by listening to what others were saying about the topic, beginning with the content creators I regularly follow and deeply respect. But I made a conscious effort not to let their opinions shape my own. I didn't want to be the kind of person who just absorbs other people's takes, tweaks a few words, and passes it off as original thought. That's a slippery slope for any blogger, podcaster, YouTuber or really any content creator. Instead, I decided to try it out for myself. I started reading, researching, and building different types of projects using nothing but vibe coding. I was doing my best to stay hands-off, because the moment you start writing actual code, it's no longer vibe coding. It's just... coding.

## The Article That Almost Didn't Happen

Once I had all the information I needed, one thought started living in my head rent-free: I should write an article about this. By that time, I had already started blogging, but I hesitated. I don't write articles just to write anything. If I'm going to write something, it has to be worth it. I treat every post like a project planned carefully, executed intentionally.

Since vibe coding is a controversial topic, I worried it might receive negative feedback or simply fall flat. **Boy, was I wrong.**

I spent about a month just thinking through the structure, content, writing style, and about 150 other little things that go into creating a solid piece. Writing the article itself took solid ten days. The first draft was nearly twice as long as the final version, but I knew most people don't have time to read long-form content, myself included. So I trimmed it down to make it more digestible.

And don't even get me started on the editing process. It was BRUTAL. I almost gave up. But as stubborn as I am, I pushed through and got it done.

For more perspective, have you ever tried updating your resume and struggled to squeeze everything into one (or two, max) pages? That was exactly the kind of pain I went through.

The result? The article titled **"I'm All In on AI, But We Need to Talk About Vibe Coding".**

## Wait‚Ä¶ What? Why Is This Blowing Up?

Whenever I write something, I always give it a final read‚Äîchecking for any spelling or grammar mistakes I might've left behind, the kind I used to make back in 7th grade. And right before I hit the Publish button, I always pause for five seconds, take a deep breath, and feel my heart start racing for no reason.

That time was no exception. It felt a little different though, this was the result of nearly three months of thinking, writing, grinding, editing, and second-guessing. I kind of knew what Axl Rose must've felt like when releasing "November Rain" after working on it for nearly a decade. (Okay, I'm joking‚ÄîI'm nowhere near Axl's level in any way. It's just a bad analogy. But as a rock fan, I had to make it.)

Honestly, I didn't have high expectations. I figured the best-case scenario would be maybe 300-ish views (if I got lucky), a few likes, and maybe one or two comments, if that.

Well... I was wrong. It surprised me how much traction it got. The article took off fast. At the time of writing this post, it has up to 31,000 views. That's something I couldn't have imagined in a million years.

Some of the comments were so thoughtful, they could've been standalone articles. I had a blast discussing different perspectives with readers, and ended up becoming a reader of their work, too.

**The developer community is AWESOME.**

## Me as a Podcast Guest? Count Me In!

I listen to podcasts all the time, covering everything from technology and software engineering to sports and science. It's fun, but nothing compares to actually participating in a podcast episode. Especially when you have an amazing host like [Tarun Donipati](https://www.youtube.com/@tarundonipati). When I think of perfectionists, I know a few but Tarun is one of the best examples of how to be a perfectionist in the best way possible.

By the way, before we go any further, check out his podcast on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Digicode-Podcast) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/0SjWBF8FfKHc4FqqUnqc31?si=090a3ac35ec14849). It's still fairly new, but I can already tell it's going to grow big, with even more interesting episodes and guests ahead.

Tarun told me our episode would run up to an hour long and that was my toughest challenge: figuring out how to fit everything I wanted to say, plus answering Tarun's great questions, all within that time.

I also didn't want to speak too fast. It's no fun sounding like you're in a speed-talking contest when people are trying to get valuable insights from you. Somehow, I managed to focus on the most important points and I couldn't have done it without Tarun's skillful hosting. His questions pushed me to think at full throttle and deliver the best answers I could.

Once again, huge thanks to Tarun for being an amazing host. I'm confident his podcast will become a hit after just a few more episodes. I know it.

The podcast was divided into several parts, which you can also find in the timestamps on the YouTube video:

1. Introduction to Vibe Coding
2. Guest Background
3. Defining Vibe Coding
4. Levels of AI Coding
5. Negatives of Vibe Coding
6. Positives of Vibe Coding
7. Learning Code with AI
8. Will AI Replace Software Engineers?
9. Conclusion and Reflections

In hindsight, I'm really amazed we managed to cover all those topics in under 43 minutes (credit to Tarun's superb editing skills). But honestly, each part (except for ‚ÄúGuest Background‚Äù) could easily make an entire podcast episode on its own, given how many layers each sub-topic has. And that's not all, I can think of at least 10 more sub-topics right off the top of my head.

In conclusion, I really hope I didn't do too badly. The pressure and responsibility were there‚Äînot from Tarun, of course‚Äîhe was incredibly supportive, but from myself, because of the high quality standards Tarun has, I just wanted to keep up with them. Plus, this was my first time ever appearing on a podcast, so I'm still pretty inexperienced in that area.

One thing's for sure: if I ever decide to start my own podcast, I now know exactly what the benchmark for quality looks like.

By the way, this is my setup where all the magic happens. Huge thanks to my brother for gifting me this amazing microphone, I‚Äôve definitely put it to good use!

## Other Great Bloggers and Articles

I've been fortunate to have meaningful conversations with some fantastic bloggers on the same platform.

During the podcast, I mentioned ‚Äúone of my connections‚Äù on DEV.TO, referring to @anchildress1 . She made incredibly insightful comments, and when I checked out her posts, I found them both interesting and enjoyable to read. Take a look for yourself, and don't forget to follow her on DEV.TO. Here's one of the best articles written by her:

## Final Thoughts and Summary

I'm certain this won't be the last time I write about vibe coding. What's next? I'm planning to build a game using only vibe coding and document every single step along the way. It'll be a series of articles. It's not happening anytime soon, but stay tuned, it will happen at some point.

**In the meantime, if there's anything specific you'd like me to explore deeper on this topic, just let me know. I'll do my best to cover all the areas you suggest.**

Until next time!
